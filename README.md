Performance Comparison of AODV and DSR Routing Protocol

The rapid development in the mobile technology and the interconnectedness of various gadgets
and appliances makes the ad-hoc technology feasible on a much greater scale than previously
studied. The availability of faster processors on mobile devices greatly aids the process of ad-hoc
networking. Several protocols and associated algorithms are available for implementing ad-hoc
networking where the infrastructure for wireless networking is limited or non-existent. To that
effect, we compare two of the On-Demand routing protocols, which have different philosophies
towards setting up an ad-hoc network. These were Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad-hoc
On Demand Distance Vector (AODV). We analyzed the behavior of these protocols at several
different scenarios targeting variable number of nodes and variable speeds of node movements.
The results from these tests and other analysis are presented in this report.
